# Challenge 1
Using pipes, subset the surveys data to include animals collected before 1995 and retain only the columns year, sex, and weight.
  
  Here are the first 30 rows

# Challenge 2
Create a new data frame from the surveys data that meets the following criteria: contains only the species_id column and a new column called hindfoot_cm containing the hindfoot_length values converted to centimeters. In this hindfoot_cm column, there are no NAs and all values are less than 3.

  Here are the first 30 rows

# Challenge 3
How many animals were caught in each plot_type surveyed?

4: Long-term Krat, Rodent, Short-term Krat, Spectab

Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using species_id). Also add the number of observations

What was the heaviest animal measured in each year?

Neotoma albigula

# Challenge 4
Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values.

Take that data frame and gather() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination

Use gather() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight. Calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type. Then spread() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight.
